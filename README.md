# CharacterGroupMovement - Sample

## Introduction:
Hi! This project was created as a recruitment task to demonstrate my skills as a Unity Developer. The goal was to implement a system enabling a group of characters to navigate an isometric map, guided by the user's clicks. Each character possesses unique randomly generated stats for speed, agility, and health. You can also dynamically change level themes and Save/Load stuff like current theme, stats and positions.

## Features:
- A* based navigation system.
- Click-based movement for multiple character navigation.
- Support for touch input.
- Unique randomized stats.
- Simple UI.
- Save/Load system.
- Theme selection using Adressables.
